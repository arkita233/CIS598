1
00:00:09,553 --> 00:00:17,473
in the future self-driving cars will be safer and more reliable than humans

2
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,351
but for this to happen we need technologies that allow cars to respond faster than humans

3
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:23,926
we need

4
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:25,489
algorithms that can drive

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,652
better than humans

6
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:29,758
and we need cameras that can see more

7
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:31,107
then humans can see

8
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:32,887
for example

9
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:36,385
imagine a self-driving car is about to make a blind turn

10
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,563
and there's an oncoming car or perhaps there's a child about to run into the street

11
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:42,531
fortunately are

12
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:44,788
future car will have the superpower

13
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:48,834
a camera that can see around corners to detect these potential hazards

14
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:53,934
for the past few years as a PhD student in the Stanford computational Imaging lab

15
00:00:54,282 --> 00:00:56,793
I've been working on a camera that can do just this

16
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:59,162
a camera that can image objects

17
00:00:59,418 --> 00:01:02,716
Kiddin Around corners or blocked from direct line of sight

18
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:06,387
so let me give you an example of what our camera can see

19
00:01:06,754 --> 00:01:13,079
this is an outdoor with experiment we conducted where our camera system is scanning the side of this building with the laser

20
00:01:13,162 --> 00:01:15,026
and the scene that we want to capture

21
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:17,825
is hidden around the corner behind this curtain

22
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:21,147
so a camera system can't actually see it directly

23
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,583
and yet somehow

24
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:24,528
are camera can still capture

25
00:01:24,673 --> 00:01:26,067
the 3D geometry

26
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:27,080
of the scene

27
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:28,846
so how do we do this

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,024
the match

29
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,835
happens here in this camera system

30
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:35,005
you can think of this as a type of high speed camera

31
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,843
not one that operates at 1000 frames per second

32
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:39,527
or

33
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,457
even a million frames per second

35
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:44,089
a trillion frames per second

36
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,932
so fast

37
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:48,226
Vatican actually capture the movement

38
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:49,566
of life itself

39
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:52,482
and to give you an example of just

40
00:01:52,536 --> 00:01:54,021
how fast light travels

42
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,067
what's compared to the speed

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,364
have a fast running comic book superhero

44
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:01,309
who can move it up to three times the speed of sound

45
00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:03,502
it takes a pulse of life

46
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:06,333
about 3.3 billionths of a second

47
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:08,278
or 3.3 nanoseconds

48
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:10,099
the travel the distance of a meter

50
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,237
in that same time

51
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,983
our superhero has move

52
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:15,931
less than the width of a human hair

53
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:17,521
that's pretty fast

55
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:23,904
actually we need to image much faster if you want to capture light moving at subcentimeter Scales

56
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:27,098
door camera system can capture photons

57
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:28,856
at time frames of

58
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,691
50 trillionth of a second

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,352
450 picosecond

60
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:34,786
can we take this

61
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,204
Ultra high-speed camera

62
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,862
and we pair it with the laser that sends out short pulses of light

63
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:45,162
each pulse travels to this visible wall and some light scatters back door camera

64
00:02:45,355 --> 00:02:49,572
we also use the wall to scatter light around the corner to the hidden

67
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:53,438
we repeat this measurement many times

68
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:57,862
the capture the arrival times of many photons from different locations on the wall

69
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,310
and after we capture this measurement

70
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:03,739
we can create a trillion frames per second video of the wall

71
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:07,096
well this world may look ordinary to our own eyes

72
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,401
at a trillion frames per second

73
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:11,765
we can see something truly incredible

74
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:13,572
we can actually see

75
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:14,710
waves of light

76
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:16,582
scattered back from the hidden scene

78
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:18,709
splashing against the wall

80
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:23,867
each of these waves carries information about the hidden object that sent it

81
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:25,916
so we can take these measurements

82
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:28,417
and passed them into a reconstruction algorithm

83
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:30,854
do then recover the 3D geometry

84
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:32,192
of this hidden scene

85
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:35,354
now I want to show you one more example

86
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,197
of an indoor scene that we capture

87
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,862
this time with a variety of different hidden objects

88
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:42,274
Elizabeth have different appearances

89
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:44,237
so they reflect light differently

90
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:49,855
for example the glossy dragon statue reflects light differently than the mirror disco ball

91
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,374
or

92
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,320
the white discus thrower statue

93
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:56,300
do we can actually see the differences in the reflected light

94
00:03:56,432 --> 00:03:58,095
by visualizing it as this

95
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,149
3D Volume

96
00:03:59,304 --> 00:03:59,816
where we

97
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:02,388
just taking the video frames and stack them together

98
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:06,553
end time here is represented as the depth dimension of this Cube

100
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,606
is bright dots that you see our reflections of light from each of the mirrored facets of the disco ball scattering against the wall over time

101
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:19,772
the bright streaks of light that you see arriving soonest in time

102
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:23,249
are from the glossy dragon statue that's closest to the wall

103
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:25,857
and the other streaks of light come from

104
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,955
reflections of light from the bookcase and from the statue

105
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:32,506
no we can also visualize these measurements

106
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:34,387
a frame by frame as a video

107
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:36,129
to directly see the scattered light

108
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:39,124
and again here we see first

109
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,135
reflections of light from the dragon closest to the wall

110
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:43,219
followed by

111
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,452
right.

112
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:45,774
from the disco ball

113
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,647
another Reflections from the bookcase

114
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:49,765
and finally we see

115
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,533
the reflected waves of light

116
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,539
from the statue

117
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:54,998
these waves of light

118
00:04:55,258 --> 00:04:56,412
Illuminating the wall

119
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:57,164
Arlo

120
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:58,096
fireworks

121
00:04:58,229 --> 00:04:59,470
that lasts for just

122
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:00,969
trillionth of a second

123
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,758
and even though these objects reflect light

124
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:08,446
differently

125
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,797
we can still

126
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:11,408
reconstruct their shapes

127
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:13,907
and this is what you can see from around the corner

128
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:18,375
I want to show you one more example that's slightly

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,980
in this video you see me dressed in this reflective suit

130
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:26,382
and our camera system is scanning the wall at a rate of 4 times every second

131
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:30,344
suit is reflective so we can actually capture enough photons

132
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:32,153
that we can see

133
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,436
where I am and what I'm doing

134
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:36,527
without the camera actually directly

135
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:37,328
Imaging

136
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:40,217
by capturing photons that scatter from the wall

137
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:41,674
to my tracksuit

138
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:44,147
back to the wall and back to the camera

139
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:45,355
we can capture this

140
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:46,623
indirect video

141
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:47,816
in real time

142
00:05:48,953 --> 00:05:50,288
and we think that this type of

143
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:52,056
practical non-line-of-sight Imaging

144
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,752
could be useful for application

145
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:55,637
including for self-driving cars

146
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:56,895
but also for

147
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:59,673
biomedical Imaging where we need to see into the

148
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,298
tiny structures of the body

149
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:07,789
perhaps we could also put similar camera systems on the robots that we send to explore other planets

150
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:11,435
they may have heard about see around corners before but

151
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,621
what I showed you today would have been impossible just two years ago

152
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:18,266
for example we can now image large room size hidden scenes

153
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:20,570
outdoors and a real-time rates

154
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:21,834
and we made

155
00:06:21,877 --> 00:06:25,354
significant advancements worth making this a practical technology

156
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:27,327
they could actually see on a car Sunday

157
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:30,083
of course they're still challenges remaining

158
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:31,628
app for example

159
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:32,448
can we image

160
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,826
hidden scenes at long distances

161
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,985
there were plenty very very few photons

162
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:40,957
with lasers that are low power and that are I say

164
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:45,887
can we create images from Photon set of scattered around many more times

165
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,135
play just a single bounce around the corner

166
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:50,765
can we take our prototype system

168
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,169
well currently large and bulky

169
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:57,060
and miniaturize it into something that could be useful for biomedical Imaging

170
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:58,139
perhaps thesaurus

171
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,169
improved home security system

172
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:01,203
or can we take this

173
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,074
new Imaging modality

174
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:07,701
and use it for other applications I think it's an exciting new technology

175
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:08,872
and there could be other things that

176
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:10,141
we haven't thought of yet

177
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:11,044
fusiform

178
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:12,200
and so

179
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:16,108
well a future with self-driving cars may seem distant to us now

180
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:21,086
we're already developing the technologies that could make cars safer and more intelligent

181
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:22,897
and with the rapid pace of

182
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:24,842
scientific discovery and innovation

183
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:27,687
you never know what new and exciting capabilities

184
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,574
could be just around the corner
