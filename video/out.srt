1
00:00:09,564 --> 00:00:17,472
in the future self-driving cars will be safer and more reliable than humans

2
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,347
but for this to happen we need technologies that allow cars to respond faster than humans

3
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:23,925
we need

4
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:25,486
algorithms that can drive

5
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:26,651
better than humans

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,756
and we need cameras that can see more

7
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:31,106
then humans can see

8
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:32,885
for example

9
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:36,385
imagine a self-driving car is about to make a blind turn

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,564
and there's an oncoming car or perhaps there's a child about to run into the street

11
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:42,531
fortunately are

12
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,788
future car will have the superpower

13
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:48,832
a camera that can see around corners to detect these potential hazards

14
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:53,932
for the past few years as a PhD student in the Stanford computational Imaging lab

15
00:00:54,282 --> 00:00:56,793
I've been working on a camera that can do just this

16
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:59,160
a camera that can image objects

17
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:02,716
Kiddin Around corners or blocked from direct line of sight

18
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:06,385
so let me give you an example of what our camera can see

19
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:13,077
this is an outdoor with experiment we conducted where our camera system is scanning the side of this building with the laser

20
00:01:13,163 --> 00:01:15,022
and the scene that we want to capture

21
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:17,826
is hidden around the corner behind this curtain

22
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:21,145
so a camera system can't actually see it directly

23
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:22,580
and yet somehow

24
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:24,528
are camera can still capture

25
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:26,068
the 3D geometry

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,079
of the scene

27
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:28,846
so how do we do this

28
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:30,024
the match

29
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:31,834
happens here in this camera system

30
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:35,004
you can think of this as a type of high speed camera

31
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:38,840
not one that operates at 1000 frames per second

32
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:39,528
or

33
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:41,450
even a million frames per second

35
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:44,089
a trillion frames per second

36
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:45,931
so fast

37
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:48,226
Vatican actually capture the movement

38
00:01:48,378 --> 00:01:49,564
of life itself

39
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,480
I'll give you an example of just

40
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:54,019
how fast light travels

41
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:56,065
what's compared to the speed

42
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:58,363
have a fast running comic book superhero

43
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:01,307
who can move it up to three times the speed of sound

44
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,502
it takes a pulse of life

45
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:06,334
about 3.3 billionths of a second

46
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:08,160
or 3.3 nanoseconds

47
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:10,099
the travel the distance of a meter

49
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:12,236
in that same time

50
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,981
our superhero has move

51
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:15,931
less than the width of a human hair

52
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:17,513
that's pretty fast

54
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:23,903
actually we need to image much faster if you want to capture light moving at subcentimeter Scales

55
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:27,098
door camera system can capture photons

56
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:28,857
at time frames of just

57
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:30,686
50 trillionth of a second

58
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:32,351
450 picosecond

59
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:34,785
3 take this

60
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:36,204
Ultra high-speed camera

61
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:39,854
and we pair it with the laser that sends out short pulses of light

62
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:45,163
each pulse travels to this visible wall and some light scatters back door camera

63
00:02:45,357 --> 00:02:49,573
but we also use the wall to scatter light around the corner to the hidden

66
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:53,439
we repeat this measurement many times

67
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:57,862
the capture the arrival times of many photons from different locations on the wall

68
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,310
and after we capture this measurement

69
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:03,740
we can create a trillion frames per second video of the wall

70
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:05,569
wildest wall Mala

71
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:07,096
ordinary tomorrow night

72
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,402
at a trillion frames per second

73
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:11,767
we can see something truly incredible

74
00:03:12,288 --> 00:03:13,568
we can actually see

75
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:14,708
waves of light

76
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:16,582
scattered back from the hidden scene

78
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,710
flashing against the wall

80
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:23,869
each of these waves carries information about the hidden object that sent it

81
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:25,916
so we can take these measurements

82
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:28,412
and passed them into a reconstruction algorithm

83
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,855
do then recover the 3D geometry

84
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:32,191
of this hidden scene

85
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:35,353
now I want to show you one more example

86
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,197
of an indoor scene that we capture

87
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:39,862
this time with a variety of different hidden objects

88
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:42,275
Elizabeth have different appearances

89
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,238
so they reflect light differently

90
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:49,846
for example this glossy dragon statue reflects light differently than the mirror disco ball

91
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:50,374
or

92
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:52,319
the white discus thrower statue

93
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:54,092
do we can actually

94
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:56,295
see the difference is in the reflected light

95
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,096
by visualizing it as this

96
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,151
3D Volume

97
00:03:59,306 --> 00:03:59,813
where we

98
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:02,390
just taking the video frames and stack them together

99
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,551
end time here is represented as the depth dimension of this Cube

101
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:15,609
is bright dots that you see our reflections of light from each of the mirrored facets of the disco ball scattering against the wall over time

102
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:19,773
the bright streaks of light that you see arriving soonest in time

103
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:23,251
are from the glossy dragon statue that's closest to the wall

104
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:25,859
and the other streaks of light come from

105
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:28,956
reflections of light from the bookcase and from the statue

106
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,508
no we can also visualize these measurements

107
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:34,389
a frame by frame as a video

108
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:36,130
to directly see the scattered light

109
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:39,125
and again here we see first

110
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:42,138
reflections of light from the dragon closest to the wall

111
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,217
followed by

112
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:44,455
right.

113
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:45,775
from the disco ball

114
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:47,647
another Reflections from the bookcase

115
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:49,767
and finally we see

116
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:51,534
the reflected waves of light

117
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:52,531
from the statue

118
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:55,000
these waves of light

119
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,415
Illuminating the wall

120
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:57,167
Arlo

121
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:58,097
fireworks

122
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,472
that lasts for just

123
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:00,960
trillionth of a second

124
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:07,751
and even though these objects reflect light

125
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:08,445
differently

126
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:09,797
we can still

127
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,411
reconstruct their shapes

128
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,908
and this is what you can see from around the corner

129
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:18,377
I want to show you one more example that's slightly

130
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:21,981
in this video you see me dressed in this reflective suit

131
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:26,384
and our camera system is scanning the wall at a rate of 4 times every second

132
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,345
suit is reflective so we can actually capture enough photons

133
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:32,156
that we can see

134
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:34,439
where I am and what I'm doing

135
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:36,530
without the camera actually directly

136
00:05:36,621 --> 00:05:37,328
Imaging

137
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,219
by capturing photons that scatter from the wall

138
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,677
to my tracksuit

139
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,149
back to the wall and back to the camera

140
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,358
we can capture this

141
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:46,625
indirect video

142
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:47,816
in real time

143
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:50,287
and we think that this type of

144
00:05:50,325 --> 00:05:52,059
practical non-line-of-sight Imaging

145
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:53,754
could be useful for applications

146
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,640
including for self-driving cars

147
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:56,897
but also for

148
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:59,676
biomedical Imaging where we need to see into the

149
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:01,301
tiny structures of the body

150
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:07,790
perhaps we could also put similar camera systems on the robots that we send to explore other planets

151
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,436
they may have heard about see around corners before but

152
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:14,624
what I showed you today would have been impossible just two years ago

153
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:18,268
for example we can now image large room size hidden scenes

154
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:20,573
outdoors and a real-time rates

155
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:21,832
and we made

156
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,355
significant advancements worth making this a practical technology

157
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:27,327
they could actually see on a car Sunday

158
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,083
of course they're still challenges remaining

159
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:31,615
app for example

160
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,451
can we image

161
00:06:32,628 --> 00:06:34,829
hidden scenes at long distances

162
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:36,988
there were plenty very very few photons

163
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:40,952
with lasers that are low power and that are I say

165
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:45,889
can we create images from Photon set of scattered around many more times

166
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:48,137
play just a single bounce around the corner

167
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,768
can we take our prototype system

169
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:53,167
well currently large and bulky

170
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,063
add Minute Rice it into something that could be useful for biomedical Imaging

171
00:06:57,136 --> 00:06:58,141
perhaps thesaurus

172
00:06:58,297 --> 00:07:00,158
improved home security system

173
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,205
or can we take this

174
00:07:01,302 --> 00:07:03,077
new Imaging modality

175
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:07,697
and use it for other applications I think it's an exciting new technology

176
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:08,875
and there could be other things

177
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,142
we haven't thought of yet

178
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,045
fusiform

179
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:12,200
and so

180
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:16,112
well a future with self-driving cars may seem distant to us now

181
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:21,089
we're already developing the technologies that could make cars safer and more intelligent

182
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:22,901
and with the rapid pace of

183
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,845
scientific discovery and innovation

184
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,689
you never know what new and exciting capabilities

185
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,578
could be just around the corner
