00:00:12,937 --> 00:00:14,112
In the future,

3
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:17,790
self-driving cars will be safer
and more reliable than humans.

4
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:19,397
But for this to happen,

5
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:22,151
we need technologies
that allow cars to respond

6
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:23,442
faster than humans,

7
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:27,180
we need algorithms
that can drive better than humans

8
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:31,307
and we need cameras
that can see more than humans can see.

9
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:36,791
For example, imagine a self-driving car
is about to make a blind turn,

10
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:38,149
and there's an oncoming car

11
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:40,958
or perhaps there's a child
about to run into the street.

12
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,022
Fortunately, our future car
will have this superpower,

13
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:49,145
a camera that can see around corners
to detect these potential hazards.

14
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:51,955
For the past few years as a PhD student

15
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:54,256
in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab,

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,034
I've been working on a camera
that can do just this --

17
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,456
a camera that can image objects
hidden around corners

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,252
or blocked from direct line of sight.

19
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:06,728
So let me give you an example
of what our camera can see.

20
00:01:06,752 --> 00:01:09,315
This is an outdoor experiment we conducted

21
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:13,149
where our camera system is scanning
the side of this building with a laser,

22
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,133
and the scene that we want to capture

23
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:18,117
is hidden around the corner
behind this curtain.

24
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:21,118
So our camera system
can't actually see it directly.

25
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:22,729
And yet, somehow,

26
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:27,301
our camera can still capture
the 3D geometry of this scene.

27
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:29,104
So how do we do this?

28
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:32,220
The magic happens here
in this camera system.

29
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:35,569
You can think of this
as a type of high-speed camera.

30
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:39,063
Not one that operates
at 1,000 frames per second,

31
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:41,832
or even a million frames per second,

32
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:44,109
but a trillion frames per second.

33
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:49,858
So fast that it can actually capture
the movement of light itself.

34
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,295
And to give you an example
of just how fast light travels,

35
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,604
let's compare it to the speed
of a fast-running comic book superhero

36
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:01,376
who can move at up to three times
the speed of sound.

37
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:06,400
It takes a pulse of light
about 3.3 billionths of a second,

38
00:02:06,424 --> 00:02:08,297
or 3.3 nanoseconds,

39
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:10,450
to travel the distance of a meter.

40
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:12,409
Well, in that same time,

41
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:16,307
our superhero has moved
less than the width of a human hair.

42
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:17,900
That's pretty fast.

43
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,760
But actually, we need to image much faster

44
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:24,172
if we want to capture light
moving at subcentimeter scales.

45
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:27,281
So our camera system can capture photons

46
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:30,821
at time frames of just
50 trillionths of a second,

47
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:32,590
or 50 picoseconds.

48
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,323
So we take this ultra-high-speed camera

49
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:40,021
and we pair it with a laser
that sends out short pulses of light.

50
00:02:40,553 --> 00:02:43,188
Each pulse travels to this visible wall

51
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:45,339
and some light scatters
back to our camera,

52
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:48,579
but we also use the wall
to scatter light around the corner

53
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,536
to the hidden object and back.

54
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:53,601
We repeat this measurement many times

55
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,165
to capture the arrival times
of many photons

56
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:58,276
from different locations on the wall.

57
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,156
And after we capture
these measurements, we can create

58
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,815
a trillion-frame-per-second
video of the wall.

59
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:07,379
While this wall may look
ordinary to our own eyes,

60
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:11,878
at a trillion frames per second,
we can see something truly incredible.

61
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:16,642
We can actually see waves of light
scattered back from the hidden scene

62
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,733
and splashing against the wall.

63
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:22,015
And each of these waves
carries information

64
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,317
about the hidden object that sent it.

65
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,022
So we can take these measurements

66
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:28,545
and pass them into
a reconstruction algorithm

67
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:32,450
to then recover the 3D geometry
of this hidden scene.

68
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,189
Now I want to show you one more example
of an indoor scene that we captured,

69
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:40,323
this time with a variety
of different hidden objects.

70
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:42,474
And these objects
have different appearances,

71
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:44,331
so they reflect light differently.

72
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:48,109
For example, this glossy dragon statue
reflects light differently

73
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,910
than the mirror disco ball

74
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:52,545
or the white discus thrower statue.

75
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:56,417
And we can actually see the differences
in the reflected light

76
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,282
by visualizing it as this 3D volume,

77
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,616
where we've just taken the video frames
and stacked them together.

78
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,939
And time here is represented
as the depth dimension of this cube.

79
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,105
These bright dots that you see
are reflections of light

80
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,675
from each of the mirrored
facets of the disco ball,

81
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,890
scattering against the wall over time.

82
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,958
The bright streaks of light that you see
arriving soonest in time

83
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:23,942
are from the glossy dragon statue
that's closest to the wall,

84
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:27,767
and the other streaks of light come from
reflections of light from the bookcase

85
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,124
and from the statue.

86
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,614
Now, we can also visualize
these measurements frame by frame,

87
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:34,830
as a video,

88
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,736
to directly see the scattered light.

89
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:41,080
And again, here we see, first,
reflections of light from the dragon,

90
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:42,350
closest to the wall,

91
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:45,763
followed by bright dots
from the disco ball

92
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:48,506
and other reflections from the bookcase.

93
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,982
And finally, we see the reflected
waves of light from the statue.

94
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,633
These waves of light illuminating the wall

95
00:04:56,657 --> 00:05:01,275
are like fireworks that last
for just trillionths of a second.

96
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:08,895
And even though these objects
reflect light differently,

97
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,553
we can still reconstruct their shapes.

98
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,337
And this is what you can see
from around the corner.

99
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:18,976
Now, I want to show you one more example
that's slightly different.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,380
In this video, you see me
dressed in this reflective suit

101
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:26,799
and our camera system is scanning the wall
at a rate of four times every second.

102
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:28,387
The suit is reflective,

103
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,069
so we can actually capture enough photons

104
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:34,641
that we can see where I am
and what I'm doing,

105
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:37,562
without the camera
actually directly imaging me.

106
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:42,125
By capturing photons that scatter
from the wall to my tracksuit,

107
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,283
back to the wall and back to the camera,

108
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:47,903
we can capture this indirect
video in real time.

109
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:52,160
And we think that this type
of practical non-line-of-sight imaging

110
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:55,910
could be useful for applications
including for self-driving cars,

111
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:58,029
but also for biomedical imaging,

112
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:01,624
where we need to see
into the tiny structures of the body.

113
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:05,475
And perhaps we could also put
similar camera systems on the robots

114
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,164
that we send to explore other planets.

115
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,601
Now you may have heard
about seeing around corners before,

116
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,199
but what I showed you today
would have been impossible

117
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:15,387
just two years ago.

118
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:19,268
For example, we can now image large,
room-sized hidden scenes outdoors

119
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:21,141
and at real-time rates,

120
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:25,522
and we've made significant advancements
towards making this a practical technology

121
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:27,839
that you could actually see
on a car someday.

122
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:30,736
But of course, there's still
challenges remaining.

123
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,823
For example, can we image
hidden scenes at long distances

124
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:37,990
where we're collecting
very, very few photons,

125
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:41,291
with lasers that are low-power
and that are eye-safe.

126
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,976
Or can we create images from photons

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,029
that have scattered around many more times

128
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:48,656
than just a single bounce
around the corner?

129
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,323
Can we take our prototype system
that's, well, currently large and bulky,

130
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,887
and miniaturize it into something
that could be useful

131
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:57,110
for biomedical imaging

132
00:06:57,134 --> 00:07:00,220
or perhaps a sort of improved
home-security system,

133
00:07:00,244 --> 00:07:05,756
or can we take this new imaging modality
and use it for other applications?

134
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,669
I think it's an exciting new technology

135
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,621
and there could be other things
that we haven't thought of yet

136
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:11,819
to use it for.

137
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:14,388
And so, well, a future
with self-driving cars

138
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:16,578
may seem distant to us now --

139
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,579
we're already developing the technologies

140
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:21,150
that could make cars safer
and more intelligent.

141
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:25,000
And with the rapid pace
of scientific discovery and innovation,

142
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:28,071
you never know what new
and exciting capabilities

143
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:30,229
could be just around the corner.

144
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,730
(Applause)
